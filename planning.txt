we have to start with a system of DMs, even if we do not display them appropriately as seperate DMs
we can call it "done" with just the following:
From Alex: Hi!
To Alex: Hello!  <-- as some form of command in client
From A.T.: Sup!
From Alex: How are you?
To A.T.: Yo! <-- also as some form of command in client

So, the plan is below.

server.py must include the functions:
    distribute_keys -- on new user join, distribute new key dictionary
    push_transmission -- push through a transmission in a message from one user to another
                         must call pull_target_id to get destination, and send to appropriate user 

client.py must include the functions:
    send_transmission -- send transmission to server
                         appropriately created by calling construct_transmission
    process_recieved_transmission.


If we want to move to more "proper" dms, we will need to extend functionality to include client-size message storage. 
This will additionally involve creating "scenes" for each messaging, a home page with options, etc.
Whether we want to pursue this with GUI or not is up for later discussion.
